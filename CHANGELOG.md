Changes on the `master` branch, from the latest version tag up to and including
HEAD can be subject to a git rebase.

## 0.1.42

* Support for using the Python tools without entering the CIJOE shell
* Support for multiple testplans per test-run
  - Arguments to ``cij_runner`` has changed
    Use: ``--testplan`` to provide one or more testplans (this replaces positional arg)
    Use: ``--env`` to provide invironment file (this replaces positional arg)
  - Structure of ``cij_runner`` output has changed
    Before: ``<OUTPUT>/testsuite_ident/...``
    Now: ``<OUTPUT>/testplan_ident/testsuite_ident/...``
    In other words, testsuites and nested beneath testplans in the test-result output.

## 0.0.35

* Added option tot disable colors in bash-output-helpers
* Added option to initialize qemu-boot image from cloud-image
* Cleanup SSH module

## 0.0.34

* Fixed typo in sysinf hook
* Removed use of dmesg-hook in `example_01_usage.plan`
* Added `example_02_usage.plan` using the dmesg-hook

## 0.0.33

* Added Dockerfile for interactive use of CIJOE
* Fixed junit-representation

## 0.0.32

* The lock-hook will no longer create lock-files on the test-target, the
  lock-hook will as such only protect one-self against one-self, e.g. abort when
  the same environment is being used. When using shared resources your resource
  manager or CI system should provide mutual exclusion to the test-target.

* The Makefile now defaults to doing user-mode uninstall + install.

* Reporter: CSS and JavaScript are now embedded to avoid requiring
  network-access to external resources when reading the reports.

Changed `cij_reporter` it now takes the output path as positional argument

```
