# Example of using the SHELL package "blktests"
#
# This example uses the "blktests" package to run a quick test, stores output
# from 'blktests' in CIJ_TEST_AUX_ROOT, and excluding the test of CPU hotplug
# during IO
#
# Using packages often requires defining specific environment variables. The
# variables to define are documented within the package source, e.g.
# modules/blktests.sh
#
# Such variables should be declared within an "env" by doing so the cij_runner
# can run on different "targets" by simply giving it a different env. As such,
# the env is glue between a testcase and the environment that it runs in.
