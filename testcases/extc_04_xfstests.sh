# Example of using the SHELL package "xfstests"
#
# One can either write a testcase with logic defining the tests within the
# script, or use the script to call another testcase e.g. as a wrapper for other
# tools, and utilities.
#
# This is an example of the latter, a wrapper for "xfstests", running the
# "generic/001" testcase as defined in "xfstests".
#
# This example uses the "xfstests" package to run a quick test, stores output
# from "xfstests" in CIJ_TEST_AUX_ROOT, and excluding the test of CPU hotplug
# during IO
#
# Using packages often requires defining specific environment variables. The
# variables to define are documented within the package source, e.g.
# modules/fs.sh
#
# Such variables should be declared within an "env" by doing so the cij_runner
# can run on different "targets" by simply giving it a different env. As such,
# the env is glue between a testcase and the environment that it runs in.
