  This workflow demonstrates how to build qemu from source

  * Build qemu from source (x86_64 and aarch64)
  * Install qemu
  * Check the qemu system version -- which the helper resolves to

  This is done via scripts, which in turn are utilizing helper-functions from
  cijoe.qemu.wrapper.

steps:
- name: repository_prep
  uses: core.repository_prep

- name: build
  uses: qemu.build

- name: install
  uses: qemu.install

- name: qemu_system_version
  uses: qemu.qemu_version
