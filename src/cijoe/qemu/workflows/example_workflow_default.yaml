  This workflow demonstrates how to use qemu via cijoe in steps of

  * Build qemu from source (x86_64 and aarch64)
  * Install qemu
  * Provision a guest using a cloud-init image
    - inject "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" into guest as authorized_keys
  * Start the guest
  * Run a command within the guest (via SSH)
  * Stop the guest again

  This is done via scripts, which in turn are utilizing helper-functions from
  cijoe.qemu.wrapper.

steps:
- name: build
  uses: qemu.build

- name: install
  uses: qemu.install

- name: cloudinit
  uses: qemu.guest_init_using_cloudinit

#
# In case you do not want to use cloud-init and you already have a bootable
# image, then comment the 'cloudinit' step above, and uncomment the 'bootimg'
# step below.
# Also, remember to adjust the config section [qemu.guest.init_using_image] to
# point to where the bootable image can be downloaded or copied from.
#
#- name: bootimg
#  uses: qemu.guest_init_using_bootimage
