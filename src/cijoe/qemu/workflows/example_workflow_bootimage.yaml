  This workflow demonstrates how to use qemu via cijoe in steps of

  * Provision a guest using a cloud-init image
  * Start the guest
  * Run a command within the guest (via SSH)
  * Stop the guest again

  This is done via scripts, which in turn are utilizing helper-functions from
  cijoe.qemu.wrapper.

steps:
- name: bootimage
  uses: qemu.guest_init_using_bootimage

- name: start
  uses: qemu.guest_start

- name: check
  run: |
    hostname

- name: kill
  uses: qemu.guest_kill
