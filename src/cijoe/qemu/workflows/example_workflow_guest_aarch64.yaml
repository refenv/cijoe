  This use of the 'qemu' shows how to initialize, start, and stop a qemu guest

  * Create a diskimage using a cloudimage

    - This is done using the 'system_imaging' package
    - Using Debian cloudinit as a reference

  * Initialize a 'system_imaging' provided disk image

    - See the 'system_imaging' package for examples of creating disk-images
    
  * Start the guest
  * Run a command within the guest (via SSH)
  * Stop the guest again

  This is done via scripts, which in turn are utilizing helper-functions from
  cijoe.qemu.wrapper.
