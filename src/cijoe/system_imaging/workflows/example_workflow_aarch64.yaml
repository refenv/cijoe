  Build disk and docker images
  ============================

  Here is what the workflow consumes and produces:

  * cloud image ==> disk image (.qcow2) ==> docker image

  This images are usable for:

  * Disk image for a virtual machine

    - This can be e.g. a qemu-guest or other host-vmm / hypervisor

  * Disk image for a physical machine

    - By writing to bootable media using qemu-img

  * Docker image

    - Run locally using Docker engine, desktop e.g. GitHUB

  It uses the 'system_imaging' section of the configuration file as input, the
  system images matching 'pattern' are processed.

  NOTE: This creates images for all aarch64 system images described in the
        "system_imaging" section of the cijoe configuration file.

steps:
- name: diskimage_from_cloudimage
  uses: system_imaging.diskimage_from_cloudimage
  with:
    pattern: "*aarch64*"

- name: dockerimage_from_diskimage
  uses: system_imaging.dockerimage_from_diskimage
  with:
    pattern: "*aarch64*"
