  This is a workflow file, it serves as an example on how to run commands and
  scripts, the structure intentionally mimics that of GitHUB actions, however,
  the keys you see here are all there is.

  Running commands, as you can see below, looks just like running commands in a
  GitHUB Workflow

  * Add the 'run' key with a value of multi-line string

  Using scripts, it is similar to that of a GitHUB action

  * Add the 'uses' key with the name of the script
    - packaged scripts have a namespaced name e.g. "my_pkg.my_script"
    - non-packaged do not e.g. "my_script"
  * Add the 'with' key providing arguments to the script

  The commands and the scripts are passed an instance of cijoe which they can
  use to call run() / get() / put(), with an output-directory matching the
  current step. This is it, end of story.

steps:
- name: inline_commands
  run: |
    cat /proc/cpuinfo
    hostname

- name: script_with_args
  uses: core.cmdrunner
  with:
    commands:
    - cat /proc/cpuinfo
    - hostname

- name: example_script
  uses: core.example_script_default
  with:
    repeat: 2

#
# Uncomment the lines below to include the non-packaged script
# 'cijoe-script.py', from the directory where you ran 'cijoe --example'
#
#- name: custom_script
#  uses: cijoe-script
