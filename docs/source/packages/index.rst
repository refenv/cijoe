 Packages
==========

A **cijoe** package is a collection of :ref:`sec-resources`, which may optionally
include a Python module, packaged within a Python package. Including a Python module is
useful when multiple :ref:`sec-resources-scripts` share common implementation details.

The packages covered in this section are **built-in**, meaning they are included by
default with the **cijoe** installation. You can also create your own package, and the
**cijoe** infrastructure will automatically recognize it, allowing it to be loaded in
the same way as the **built-in** :ref:`sec-resources`.

If you prefer not to create and distribute a Python package via PyPi, **cijoe** can
still collect and use your locally available :ref:`sec-resources` without additional
steps.
